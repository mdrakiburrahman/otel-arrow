# Pluggable Arrow pipeline data

This document describes the first production slice of pluggable Arrow pipeline
data tracked by
[open-telemetry/otel-arrow#3875](https://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/issues/3875).
It establishes the in-memory carrier, codec registration, and fail-closed
wiring behavior needed by a future Arrow Flight receiver. It does not implement
the Flight server, a Delta exporter, mixed-signal envelopes, or durable
persistence for the new representation.

## In-memory representation

`PdataArrowRecordSet` owns a named and versioned set of Arrow `RecordBatch`
values. Each table preserves:

- a format-local `u32` table ID;
- an adapter-defined schema ID;
- the exact 256-bit schema fingerprint supplied by the adapter; and
- the owned `RecordBatch`.

The carrier does not depend on OTAP protobuf payload enums or an
application-specific protocol crate. The representation adapter defines the
meaning of table IDs, schema IDs, root-item counts, and table relationships.

Cloning the carrier clones Arrow's reference-counted schema and array handles.
It does not copy array buffers. This makes the carrier suitable for ordinary
bounded DFE channels and fan-out while preserving the existing ownership model.

```rust,ignore
use otel_arrow_dfe_config::SignalType;
use otel_arrow_dfe_pdata::{
    PdataArrowRecordSet, PdataArrowTable, PdataRepresentation,
    PdataRepresentationId, PdataSchemaId, RepresentationVersion,
    SchemaFingerprint,
};

let representation = PdataRepresentation::new(
    PdataRepresentationId::new("example.logs"),
    RepresentationVersion::new(1, 0),
);
let table = PdataArrowTable::new(
    7,
    PdataSchemaId::new("example.logs.root"),
    SchemaFingerprint::new(adapter_fingerprint),
    record_batch,
)?;
let records = PdataArrowRecordSet::new(
    representation,
    SignalType::Logs,
    root_item_count,
    [table],
)?;
```

`OtapPayload` carries this value as `PayloadData::PdataArrowRecords`.
Signal type, representation identity, item count, logical Arrow size, and
retained memory remain available without protobuf or Arrow IPC serialization.
Existing `OtapArrowRecords` and `OtlpProtoBytes` remain optimized variants.
`OtapPayload::representation()` exposes their compatibility identities through
the same identity model.

## Registration and conversion

`otel-arrow-dfe-pdata-codec` provides `register_pdata_arrow_codec!`.
Registration always enables identity discovery and pass-through. Conversion to
or from native OTAP is optional:

```rust,ignore
use otel_arrow_dfe_pdata_codec::{
    ArrowCodecMetadata, ArrowCodecRegistration, register_pdata_arrow_codec,
};

static EXAMPLE_METADATA: ArrowCodecMetadata = ArrowCodecMetadata::new(
    EXAMPLE_REPRESENTATION,
    &[SignalType::Logs],
);

register_pdata_arrow_codec!(
    EXAMPLE_CODEC,
    ArrowCodecRegistration::new(&EXAMPLE_METADATA)
        .with_decoder(create_decoder)
        .with_encoder(create_encoder),
);
```

A pass-through-only representation omits both factories. `CodecService`
creates registered mutable codec instances lazily per pipeline when a caller
uses `decode_arrow` or `encode_arrow`. Looking up an unregistered identity
returns `RegistryError::ArrowNotFound`; requesting a missing conversion
direction returns a typed unsupported-operation error.

The built-in OTLP byte codec now publishes structured version `1.0` and its
bidirectional capabilities through `CodecMetadata::representation()` and
`ResolvedCodec::capabilities()`. Native OTAP remains a direct compatibility
variant rather than being wrapped in a pluggable record set. Migrating native
OTAP table operations into the generalized registry is deliberately deferred.

## Wiring validation

Node factories declare one of these coarse startup contracts:

- `PdataWiringContract::STANDARD` for existing OTAP/OTLP-specific nodes;
- `PdataWiringContract::PASSTHROUGH` for nodes that preserve any
  representation;
- `PdataWiringContract::PLUGGABLE_ARROW_SOURCE` for a future Arrow receiver; or
- `PdataWiringContract::PLUGGABLE_ARROW_SINK` for an Arrow-only exporter; or
- `PdataWiringContract::ACCEPT_ALL` for a representation-agnostic sink.

The pipeline builder propagates possible representation families through the
graph. A pass-through processor preserves the incoming family. If pluggable
Arrow data can reach a standard-only processor or exporter, pipeline
construction fails with `Error::IncompatiblePdataWiring`.

The fan-out, retry, and signal-type router processors declare pass-through
behavior, and the noop exporter accepts all representations. Other existing
processors and exporters remain standard-only until they implement an explicit
Arrow capability.

The following is a topology example only. The component URNs do not exist yet:

```yaml
# Not runnable until the dependent Flight receiver and Delta exporter work lands.
nodes:
  flight:
    type: receiver:arrow_flight
  retry:
    type: processor:retry
  delta:
    type: exporter:delta
connections:
  - from: flight
    to: retry
  - from: retry
    to: delta
```

The future receiver factory must declare
`PLUGGABLE_ARROW_SOURCE`. The future exporter must declare
`PLUGGABLE_ARROW_SINK` before this topology can validate. The startup wiring
contract is intentionally coarse-grained in this slice; exact representation
identity and version support is resolved through the codec registry and
component configuration/runtime validation.

## Quiver status

The current Quiver format stores standard OTAP tables in a fixed 64-slot
namespace and does not persist a pluggable representation manifest, format
identity/version, arbitrary table IDs, or schema IDs. Mapping the new carrier
onto those slots would invent unsafe persistence semantics.

The durable-buffer processor therefore returns
`BundleConversionError::UnsupportedRepresentation` with capability `Persist`
and permanently NACKs the complete payload. A future Quiver format must persist
the representation identity, table and schema identities, fingerprints, and
record batches before this restriction can be removed.

## Integration boundary for the Flight receiver

The next worker can:

1. decode or adapt an incoming Flight batch into `PdataArrowTable` values;
2. preserve the sender or adapter schema fingerprint exactly;
3. construct `PdataArrowRecordSet` with the registered identity and root count;
4. call `CodecService::admit_arrow` to fail closed if the identity/version or
   signal is not registered;
5. wrap it with `OtapPayload::from_pdata_arrow`; and
6. send the resulting `OtapPdata` through the normal bounded effect-handler
   channel.

The receiver must not claim native OTAP conversion unless a registered
`PdataArrowDecoder` actually implements it.
